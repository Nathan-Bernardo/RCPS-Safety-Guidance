# Summary 
* What
  - Safety Gym is a simulator meant for testing the effectiveness of constrained reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
  - Contains a benchmark of 18 high-dimensional continous controll environments for safe exploration.
  - Contains 9 additional environments for debugging task perofrmance separatel from safety requirements.
  - Allows for customizable environments.
  - Contains 3 different agents: Point, Car, and Doggo. Point is constrained in 2D-plane, car resides in 2D-plane, and doggo is a quadripedal robot.
  - 
  - Contains 3 different tasks: Goal, Button, and Push.
  - Contains 5 constrained elements.
